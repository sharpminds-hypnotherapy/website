## About Julie Sharp

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "images/JuliePics/20200930_Sharp_Julie_100rPOLO-SCARF-CLOSED.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

My name is **Julie Sharp** and I founded **Sharp Minds Hypnotherapy** in order to **help people change their lives** for the better.

Writing stuff on an 'About Me' page is a little different to 'about ME’. Yes, I can explain what I do and my qualifications, but what does that really tell you about Julie the person? Here are a few impressions from people I've met in diverse settings.

*'I met Julie some time ago through a networking group and immediately warmed to her approach. Making time for a follow-up, I learned about what she did and realised she was responding intuitively to the greater pull of hypnotherapy (at the time, she was working in another sector). She’s a brilliant, insightful and confident presenter who gives everyone something to take away and think about. But what strikes me most about Julie is that she is unapologetically human and incurably passionate about helping others help themselves.'*

*'When I first met Julie, I knew within a few minutes that I could work with her to recover my
wellbeing. I felt instantly comfortable talking to her. She was genuinely kind, completely professional, positive and resourceful. More importantly, she really listened to me to the extent that every session I attended had been thoroughly prepared with my needs in mind and taught me so much about myself. I am a different person today because of that whole experience...thank you Julie,..... and the lasting effects have left me stronger, happier and living a more authentic life.'*

*When I think about Julie immediately two words come to mind: passion and enthusiasm! And Julie’s passion and enthusiasm for being the best she can in life mirrors what she wants for her clients too. There’s a warmth and genuineness about her that colours her whole
attitude to life. She doesn’t make false promises. She doesn’t judge. She meets people where they are and
takes them where they want to be. She works hard to keep up to date with current research not only in the field of hypnotherapy but across a breadth of fields. She takes her professional development seriously and you’ll find as many books on her shelves relating to neuroscience, the plasticity of the brain and the science of addiction as you will on inner child healing and managing emotions. Julie is resilient and courageous and her courage is infectious. She has a deep understanding of how to relate to others’ pain and distress. Julie has those incredible qualities that enable deep therapeutic relationships to form and encourages her clients to feel valued, safe and
heard. She recognises the in-built need we all have to be authentic. She makes it okay to throw
away the masks, disguises and props we so often use to hide our true selves. She leads by
example and it’s hard not to follow her lead.*

*I have had the pleasure of working closely with Julie and respect her tireless determination and dedication to be at the top of her field. I value her friendship, her knowledge, and her determination to improve the lives of others through being the best she can be.
I too have experienced her support with a long-term sleep problem and can say in all honesty that I have never tired of hearing her voice on the recordings she has done for me, and her clever use of language to restore me to my natural sleep patterns. I have worked with Julie on a professional basis for three years now and have no hesitation is saying that her work is ethical, sound and I feel proud to share some of my reflections of Julie with any new or potential clients seeking her support. You are in good hands.*

*Our daughter suffered acute floating anxiety about 8 years ago and during this
time has had treatment from many professionals, with limited success.
I was aware that Julie had good experience in this field treating people
suffering from similar disorders using hypnotherapy and relaxation techniques.
I mentioned it to our daughter, who was particularly bad at the time, and she
agreed to give it a go and got on very well with her.
As a fellow healthcare professional, I was fascinated and impressed with the
time Julie took to explain to our daughter what was happening when she
experienced anxiety attacks.
Julie prepared a booklet for her explaining how and why the anxiety response
occurs, the role of the amygdala - our primitive brain - and how we can change
the structure and function of our brain to respond in more helpful ways,
through techniques such as Julie advocates. It all made such a lot of sense and
what she said strongly resonated with me. It was also written in a light-hearted
way, so an easy read.
Through speaking with Julie I know that she has a very strong belief that
helping people understand why they’re feeling or behaving the way they are, is
an important first step in getting better, and she has worked hard to help
alleviate the debilitating effects of anxiety for our daughter.
Our daughter uses the relaxation recordings Julie has given her of the specific
hypnotherapy techniques that help her, which she can use at any time;
recently these helped her get home from a holiday abroad!
We are extremely grateful to Julie for her help with our daughter and it is very
reassuring to know that we have her support.*

I am a **fully qualified Hypnotherapist & NLP practitioner** and am **registered** with the **CNHC** (Complimentary and Natural Healthcare Council), **GHSC** (General Hypnotherapy Standards Council) and **HSOH** (Hampshire School of Hypnotherapy). I was trained by Lorraine Gleeson of Hampshire School of Hypnotherapy whose approach was personally commended to me by C. Roy Hunter, a globally recognised leader in the hypnotherapy profession and author of several highly acclaimed published works. My training spanned a year and involved over 450 hours of theory and practice. Although many hypnotherapists practise script reading alone, I have been taught to **deal with root causes using IMR** (ideo-motor response) and other advanced uncovering techniques. Whilst a script reading only approach can bring about a permanent change, this depends on the susceptibility of the client and on there being no underlying causes that may act as a subconscious blocker.

I am also a trained **Virtual Gastric Band** therapist, am a **Parts Therapy** practitioner, **taught by the world-renowned C Roy Hunter**, have been trained to **Lift Depression Fast**, using a Human Givens approach. I believe learning never stops and I learn as much from my clients and day-to-day practice, as I do from attending formal courses and reading books and other literature.

### Freedom from self-limiting beliefs

<div class="box">
  <p>
  On a final note, I believe that we should seek to help enrich the lives of others, not leave them impoverished. I didn’t come into hypnotherapy to become a world-famous stage hypnotist, nor to make my fortune, I came into hypnotherapy in order to help others live more fulfilling lives, <b>free from self-limiting beliefs</b> about what they can or can’t do or achieve, who they are or who they aren’t and the negative behaviours that trap the person into feeling other than how they truly wish to feel.
  </p>
</div>

I am non-judgemental in life generally, but particularly so in hypnotherapy. In a sense (and with no disrespect), I don’t care what has caused an issue in my clients’ lives, or what has happened to them in the past. Whatever it was, it didn’t kill them! I have no interest in drawing a particular conclusion about their predicament; my interest lies in their future, in helping them **cut the ties that bind them (consciously or subconsciously) to past events**. I am here to affirm life not criticize it; in helping my clients **achieve freedom from the thoughts and behaviours** that they feel have been holding them back. We all deserve to **live the best lives we possibly can** and my happiness comes from their [success](../client-feedback/index.html).
